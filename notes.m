Object Definition:

The weather object has an apiKey property, which holds the API key as a string: "5416e8b9403291f6a9c83de11f992c00".
Method Definition:

The fectWeather method (which is likely a typo and should be fetchWeather) is defined as a function that makes an HTTP request to the OpenWeatherMap API to get the current weather data for Jerusalem.
Fetching Weather Data:

Inside the fectWeather method:
The fetch function is used to send a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API endpoint: "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=jerusalem&appid=5416e8b9403291f6a9c83de11f992c00".
The API URL includes the city name (q=jerusalem) and the API key (appid=5416e8b9403291f6a9c83de11f992c00).
Handling the Response:

The fetch function returns a promise that resolves to the response of the request.
The then method is used to handle the response. The first then converts the response to JSON format.
The second then method logs the JSON data to the console.
